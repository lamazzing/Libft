# Libft
This is one of the first projects in 42 and consists in replicating some of the most used functions from libc and any function that we consider useful in the development of the following projects.
All functions and projects must follow the norm which can somehow affect the writing, here are some rules.
Sample from the norm:

Each function must have a maximum of 25 lines.  
Each line cannot have more than 80 columns, commentary included. Warning: a tab does not count as a column but instead the n spaces it represents.  
Only one instruction per line.  
Only one variable declaration per line.  
We cannot make a declaration and instantiation on the same line, at the exception of global variables and static variables.  
You are forbidden to use:  
for  
do...while  
switch  
case  
goto  
Each operator (binary or ternary) and operand must be separated by a single space.  
etc... (the rule list goes on for 6 pages).  
We are of course restricted in the use of external libraries and functions depending on each projects. We are expected to code every functions needed for the project if they are within our reach.  
# Some interesting projects:  
ft_printf which is a replica of the original printf function, you can check the list srcs in the printf.h
get_next_line a useful function to read lines from a file

The functions are not commented as they are quite straight forward.
